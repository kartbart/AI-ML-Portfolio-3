In this repository, you will find a Jupyter Notebook that employs the XGBoost Regressor Model to forecast the operational demand hours needed by engineers. This predictive model is a powerful tool that uses gradient boosting techniques to provide accurate and efficient predictions.

The data used in this model is split into two categories: weekdays and weekends. This split allows for a detailed comparison of the results, providing a deeper understanding of the operational patterns and demands during these different periods. By doing this, we can identify any significant differences in the demand hours between weekdays and weekends.

The purpose of this breakdown is to understand the operational demands better. It helps the business identify trends, patterns, and anomalies that might exist in the data. Which can lead to more effective resource allocation, improved operational efficiency, and ultimately, better service delivery.
